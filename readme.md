## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**Engage** is a citizen engagement system that enables governments to collect and respond to citizen feedback and complaints efficiently.

Citizens can create **tickets** (either feedback or complaints) and assign them to a **topic** (called a *tag* in the app). Each tag is linked to specific government departments, and tickets are automatically sent to all officials whose departments are relevant to the selected tag.

Tickets can be tracked by citizens, and there is an option to enable **email notifications** for ticket updates at the time of ticket creation.

Users are added to the system by an **admin**, and upon being added, each user receives an email with their login credentials.
